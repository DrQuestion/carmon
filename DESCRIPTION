Description: Reconstructs networks from multi-omics data sets, harnessing
    the original probability distribution of the omics layers, through the
    use of copulas. Use the main function carmon() to perform all the 
    functional steps of the package. These encompass copula-based data 
    transformation, network reconstrution, network analysis, and plot of the
    results.
